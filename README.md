**This project was created for Server 4 on Tough Society, meaning it is now outdated. Feel free to fork and edit!**

# Installation
To use TSBOT, you need to have Python 2.7 installed, and using PIP, install Selenium.
You also need to have Google Chrome webdriver installed, this can be found in a google search.

In your command line, type `py tsbot.py USERNAME PASSWORD LOOPS MELT`

If you type "melt", the script will go to the melt page and begin to melt your more valuable cars. Do not use this if you have exclusive cars, and you do not want them to be melted, do not type "melt"

# Usage
This bot automatically commits crimes, gtas and melts cars. It also knows when you are in jail and waits until the timer is up before continuing the script. When a captcha code comes up, type in the code seen on your browser to the command line for it to carry on the script.

## Working on
- Printing messages when on command line
- Commiting only avaliable crimes
- Inviting a selected list of users to Organised Crimes
- OOP
